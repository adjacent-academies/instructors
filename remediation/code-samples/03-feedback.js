feedback for 03-concat.js:

This is awesome!  I have some picky things to point out, but really this is great.

1) Your testing function:

Woo hoo!  Here your testing function is looking for an array and you're giving it an array!  Woo hoo all is right in data type land!

2) Code cleanliness is always a good thing

Very picky of me, but as you move forward, it would be great if you'd delete unused code (lines 2-4, 11, 13) from the page before you turned it in.  Polish really does matter as you move towards doing this professionally.

3) Very picky point of mine, forgive me. . .

What if one of the original arrays given as an argument had a string with a comma in it?  In other words what if the two arrays that needed to be concatenated were: ['two,words', 234], [true, 'waffles,pancakes']? I'm pretty sure that would break this.  Can you think of a way to be prepared for this possibility?

4) Pro tip

One of my favorite things in EC6 has been the spread operator.  This is advanced so don't beat yourself up for not knowing it, but it would be very useful in this instance:
