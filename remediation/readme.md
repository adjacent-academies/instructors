## Introduction

Look in the `code-samples` directory to see three code samples from **the same** student. Your goal is to figure out what they're confused about a give them feedback.

## activity

Look at the three code samples and write a review as if this were code written by one of your students. Each file represents one "exercise" where they're given a description of what the function is meant to doand the function definition, but otherwise the file is empty.

For example, this is what the student sees when starting the `countValue` exercise: <https://github.com/jfarmer/exercises-javascript-fundamentals/blob/master/exercises/arrays/countValue/countValue.js>

What do you think they're confused about? How can you give feedback that helps them be less confused? What technical concepts are they misunderstanding and in what way are they misunderstanding it?
