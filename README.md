# instructor alignment

instructional activities vary daily and adjacent instructors must remain flexible and responsive to student demands.  this requires slack in their schedule so the ability to quickly assess student work and provide incisive feedback or deliver an unprepared presentation are useful skills for a fallback plan when time gets tight.

the following exercises are intended to support skill development in these areas:

## remediation

students ask questions, submit work or take a test. grading tests and reviewing code takes time.  how do you respond effectively to this output without getting buried in work?  this activity simulates a student submission for a graded test.  see the readme in the related folder for details.

## orientation

students benefit from early guidance and scaffolding.  preparing lectures and presentations takes time.  how do you introduce a new subject with enough clarity and scaffolding to get students moving in a productive direction without spending many hours or days drafting the perfect lecture?  this activity simulates that experience.  see the readme in the related folder for details.
