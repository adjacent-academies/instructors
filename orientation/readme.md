## introduction

given this activity (students have only just arrived), what would your introduction be?

## activity

record yourself explaining this to one or more incoming student(s) with zero knowledge of coding. how would you size the explanation and provide supporting evidence of your explanation?  what tools would you employ to help clarify your explanation? (ie. by using a whiteboard, inspecting the runtime state changes with a debugger, etc.)

if you do produce code as output, please submit a PR so we can inspect the diff.  \
--> name the branch for the PR `orientation.new--YOUR_NAME`

have improvements to this activity?   \
--> submit a PR on a branch named `content.[fix|new]--YOUR_SUGGESTION`

## steps

1. `git clone` this repo
2. choose one of the following activities to introduce to students
   1. scavenger hunt (easy)
   2. recursion (moderate)
   3. virtual machine (difficult)
3. decide how to provide an effective orientation to newly arrived students (you can assume that about half the class has never installed a program on their computer before, some have Windows machines, maybe 1 in 10 students has taken a single programming class)
4. record yourself while you do what you do best: provide a meaningful orientation
