# Orientation: Scavenger Hunt

(Editor's note: I'd deliver this verbally.)

Welcome to Adjacent!

Most of you have never read or written a line of code. We want to spend today doing a bit of both.

Learning to code isn't like learning your first foreign language â€” it's more like learning your first language *ever*. When you learn your first foreign language, you have your native language as a touchpoint. A native English-speaker learning German can always ask, "I know how to say X in English. How do I say X in German?" Like a child learning their first language, you can't even ask that question when learning how to code for the first time!

Like a child sitting in a room full of adults, listening and repeating what they hear, I want us to spend the next hour in groups look at other people's code without worrying about having to understand it.

## Scavenger Hunt

I'm going to give you a list of JavaScript concepts/syntax and a list of projects that have JavaScript files in them. You'll split into groups, pick a project at random, and try to find as many of those concepts in the project as you can.

The goal isn't to understand the concepts, but to start to develop familiarity. You'll play around with GitHub for the first time. You'll navigate through source code for the first time. You'll be having conversations about code and files and line numbers for the first time.

Did we ask you to find an example of a string in JavaScript and you don't know what it is? Google "javascript string" and see if you can't find some resources that tell you what to look for.

Every 15 minutes I'm going to scramble the groups up. We'll be doing this for the next 45 minutes, followed by 15 minutes to talk about what patterns we noticed.

Be fearless! The code won't hurt you. You can't break anything. The more familiarity you build early on the less intimidated you'll be when you have to read other people's code for understanding.

## Your Peers

You'll also learn a bit about one of the most important resources here: your peers. Everyone here has slightly different experience. Learning how to help one another and how to talk about code together will carry you through almost anything.

## Demo

Here I would walk through the logistics of the exercise: how to save the URLs, how them how to select lines of code in GitHub and save the URL, etc.
