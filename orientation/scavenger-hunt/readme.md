## scavenger hunt!

**motivation**

reading changes the way we think about and see the world.  reading code helps us develop an intuition for what's possible, what's good and what works.  this challenge is about reading *a lot* of code.  have fun!

**introduction**
- the list below identifies several key parts of JavaScript syntax.  for each item, find **3 examples** in an open source project.
- you are given a list of "popular" open source projects in the included file, `popular-microjs-projects.json`.  each of these projects may have 1 or more JavaScript (`.js`) files associated with it.  this is the subject of your study

**process**

0. pick one or more projects from the list of `popular-microjs-projects.json` to study.  if you can't decide which one to study, just pick the 7th one in the list because *7 is your lucky number*.
1. for each line item listed in **the hunt** below, look for the item in the source code
2. once you find it, since (almost) all these projects are on Github, click the line number(s) in the source code and bookmark it (don't forget to organize your bookmarks like you would your files!)
3. rinse and repeat all the way down the list
4. ask lots of questions, especially if you find (or don't find) something you're interested in or curious about

**the hunt**

_(if you want to check these boxes off you'll need to "fork" this gist to your own account first)_

- [x] finish reading all of the above

- [ ] find a multi-line comment (hint: look for the `/* ... */`)
- [ ] find a documentation comment (hint: look for the `/** ... */`)
- [ ] find a variable declared with `var` (as of 2015, `var` is discouraged because of it's confusing relationship with scope)

- [ ] find an arrow function (`(x,y,z) => { ... }`)
- [ ] find a `try ... catch` block
- [ ] find a `require` or an `import` statement

- [ ] find a binary operator (hint: look for arithmetic operators)
- [ ] find a Boolean operator (hint: look for operators that reduce the expression to `true` or `false`)
