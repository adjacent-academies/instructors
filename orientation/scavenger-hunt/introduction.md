# Introduction: Scavenger Hunt

(NOTE: This would be explained in a video chat with the students)

Hi everyone, nice to meet you!

Today we're going to take our first steps towards learning how to code!
For this project we're going to look through many examples of Javascript code.
The code is going to look intimidating and unintelligible at first
but by the end of this exercise you should start seeing common patterns appear across most of the examples.

## Scavenger Hunt
Introducing: the Scavenger Hunt!
We're going to look through the code of several well-known Javascript projects. 
As we slowly look through the files, keep an eye out for items that appear on your scavenger list.
The items on your list are very common in Javascript code (and in other programming languages as well) so try to find each item **3 times**.

Let's look at the first Javascript project together.

> I will share my screen and open up the `projects.json` file, copy the URL of the first project, and open their Github Repo.
I'll briefly describe `lscache`, demonstrate how popular it is by looking at their NPM stats so the students understand they aren't looking at toy examples,
and show them how to look for files that end in `.js`. I'll open up a file (still sharing my screen) and slowly scroll down.
The students will call out when they see a scavenger item and I'll show them how to save the line location.
After the first file, students will attempt to complete the rest of the exercise on their own

## Take-aways
After the exercise I'll ask the students what they learned from this exercise as well as some challenges they came across.
Did they overcome those obstacles or are they still stuck? I'll make a note of any persistent challenges.
Hopefully one of the take-aways is that they learned to be less afraid of reading code.

I'll re-iterate that it's okay to not understand the code they just saw.
Instead the goal of this exercise is to see that vastly different projects are created from the same building blocks,
which is why the same code snippets appear over and over again.
They'll be learning how to use these building blocks over the next few months!

## How to handle questions
I anticipate that I'll get questions about Booleans, Strings, Objects, etc.
For each question I'll demonstrate how to google for the answers. If they still have questions then I will give examples of each type
so they understand what the type represents.
